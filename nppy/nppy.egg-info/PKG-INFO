              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:

                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Neural Pre-processing Python(NPPY) 
![Top: An overview of Neural Pre-processing. Bottom: The network archiecture of Neural Pre-processing](figure/pipeline_v2.png)

**Objective**: NPPY is an end-to-end weakly supervised learning approach for converting raw head MRI images to intensity-normalized, skull-stripped brain in a standard coordinate space. 

**Methods**: NPPY solves three sub-tasks simultaneously through a neural network, without individual sub-task supervision. The sub-tasks include geometric-preserving intensity mapping, spatial transformation, and skull stripping. The model disentangles intensity mapping and spatial normalization to solve the under-constrained objective. 

**Results**: NPPY outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which tackle only a single sub-task, according to quantitative results. The importance of NPP's architecture design is demonstrated through ablation experiments. Additionally, NPP provides users with the flexibility to control each task during inference time. 

# Instructions
Neural Pre-processing Python(NPPY) can be accessed as a python library package.
 
## Python library package
To use the NPP python (nppy) library, either clone this repository and install via 'pip install -e .' or install directly with pip.

```
pip install nppy
```

### Usage
Once you download the Neural Pre-processing docker script, you can use NPP with the following command-line syntax:
 

``` 
nppy -i input_folder -o output_folder -s -g -w -1
```

In this command, "input_folder" represents the path to the input folder and "output_folder" is the pre-processed output folder path. NPP generates brain mask, intensity normalized brain and intensity normalized brain in the standard coordinate space. 
For the large majority of images with voxel sizes near 1 mm3, NPP should run in less than 10 seconds on the CPU. As image size or resolution increases, the runtime might increase as well. If you encounter any issues, please contact the NPP development team for support.

See list of pre-trained models available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zbwuqinhuvf0thz/npp_v1.pth?dl=0).

# Data:
The Neural Pre-processing python(NPPY) model has been trained on a combination of seven different datasets, namely GSP, ADNI, OASIS, ADHD, ABIDE, MCIC, and COBRE. However, please note that most of the data used in the NPP papers cannot be shared due to redistribution restrictions. Nonetheless, if any researcher requires access to the Freesurfer outputs utilized during the training process, please feel free to contact me.
